    "In the OpenAI API, each of these terms refers to a different type of task or function that the API can perform. Here is a brief description of each and some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Completion: Completion refers to the task of generating text to complete a given prompt. [...]\n",
    "Example: You could use the API to generate a short description of a product based on a prompt like \"Describe the features of a new smartphone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: Classification refers to the task of assigning a category or label to a given input. This is often used in natural language processing to classify text into different categories, such as topics or sentiments.\n",
    "Example: You could use the API to classify news articles into categories such as sports, politics, or business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search: Search involves finding relevant results based on a user's input, often by matching keywords or concepts in the input to similar keywords or concepts in a database or corpus.\n",
    "Example: You could use the API to provide search results for a given query, such as \"find me articles about machine learning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Answer refers to the task of generating a direct answer to a specific question, often based on a large corpus of knowledge.\n",
    "Example: You could use the API to generate an answer to a factual question, such as \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning involves training a pre-existing language model on a specific dataset or task, to improve its performance on that task. This is often done by feeding the model examples of the task to be performed, along with the desired output. By adjusting the model's parameters based on the examples, the model can learn to perform the task more accurately.\n",
    "Example: You could fine-tune a pre-trained language model to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews of a product, in order to determine whether the reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
